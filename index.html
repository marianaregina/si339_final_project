            <h1> Movie Facts</h1>
        <p>The following is a list of some of my favorite facts about the movies I mention on this site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In The Social Network the writers purposefully has characters repeat words/phrases during their conversations with other characters to make the audience feel more a part of the movie.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interstellar was fact checked with multiple scientists to see if they were depicting an accurate representation of what could be in a black hole as well as all of the math and science in the movie.
            </li>
            <li>
                In Knives Out one of the characters improvised a curse word into a scene and the director had to cut it because he wanted the movie to have a PG-13 rating in order to give as many people as possible an opportunity to watch the film
            </li>
            <li>
                Catch Me If You Can is based on a real story and losely inspired the TV show White Collar
            </li>
            <li>
                Parasite was the first foreign language film to win an Oscar
            </li>
            <li>
                Harrison Ford who plays Han Solo (one of the main characters in the original trilogy) hates the Star Wars franchise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rouge One fits between the last prequel movie and the first orignal trilogy movie. It serevs to explain why the Death Star can be easily defeated by a single blast to a specific area of the ship.
            </li>
